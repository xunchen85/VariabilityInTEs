# Variability_In_TEs

## Introduction
Scripts included in this repository were used for the main analyses in the article of "Transposable elements are associated with the variable response to influenza infection" (In submission).

## inputs
files under this folder were used as the inputs for the R scripts. Few files were not uploaded due to the limitation of file size will be deposited to zenodo.

## shell scripts
TEPeak_detection.sh shell script was used to detect TE instances that were overlapped with ATAC-seq or Chip-seq peaks. 
TEPeak_shuffle.sh was used to generate the expected distribution of peaks that are overlapped with each TE family.
These scripts are optimied based on the scripts wrote by Bordan et al. (https://github.com/lubogdan/ImmuneTE) Python scripts were written and used in these shell scripts.
